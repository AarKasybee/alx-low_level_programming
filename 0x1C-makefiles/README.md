0x1C. C - Makefiles

Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex
tasks with dependencies.

The “make” program in Linux is used to compile and manage a set of source
code applications and files. It allows developers to install and gather a
range of apps via the terminal. It also controls and cuts down on the amount
of time necessary for compilation. The basic objective of the make command is
to break down a large program into smaller chunks and determine if it needs
to be recompiled. It also has all of the necessary instructions for recompiling
them. In this article, we will be installing the make program on the Ubuntu
system.
